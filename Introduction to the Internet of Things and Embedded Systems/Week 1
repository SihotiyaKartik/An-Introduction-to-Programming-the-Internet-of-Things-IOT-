There are several devices which were not an IoT device in past, but now they are IoT device. I will take Television as an example for my case study. In 2008, Samsung was among the first few companies to develop a smart TV. A smart TV, also known as a connected TV, is a traditional television set with integrated Internet which allows users to stream music and videos, browse the internet, and view photos. 


FUNCTIONS OF THE DEVICE IN THE PAST:-
1) In Past, the only function of the device was that the people can see different channels of movies, news, entertainment, music, cartoons, and a lot more that were broadcasted on television.


FUNCTIONS OF THE DEVICE NOW:-
1) Now the device is connected to the internet because of which several features were added and it becomes smart TV from normal TV.
2) Browsing the web. The built-in browser enables us to access the internet and allows us to surf across the internet.
3) We can now watch the content of different OTT platforms and can use youtube.
4) Get connected with social media and play games.
5) Video calling with our freinds and family.
6) Creating photo slideshows.


Every device comes with some pros and cons. The cons of this device after connecting with the internet are:-
1) Threat of Cyber attacks
2) Risk of Hanging like a computer
3) Loss of Privacy
4) Risk of getting virus
5) Risk of getting spy because of hidden cameras and voice listening capacity
