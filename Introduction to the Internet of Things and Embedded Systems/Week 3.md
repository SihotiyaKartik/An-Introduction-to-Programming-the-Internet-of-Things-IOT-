<h2>Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. There are several microcontroller manufacturers that you can investigate including Atmel, Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc. For each microcontroller, report the following information. (Be sure to include a link to an online reference where you found this information.)  </h2>

<h2>Research the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms. </h2>
<hr>
<p>Raspberry Pi is a mini-computer and Arduino is a microcontroller. Raspberry Pi boards run a specially designed version of the Linux operating system which is Raspbian an open source operating system and Arduino lacks a full operating system but can run a written code that is interpreted by its firmware.</p>
